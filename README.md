This study applies novel advanced statistical methods to airborne laser scanning data to detect and classify standing dead trees (SDTs) and lying dead trees (LDTs) 
The methods include the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for SDTs and template matching techniques for LDTs to improve the efficiency of deadwood detection.
The scripts are part of my thesis. The analysis apply only for .las files and aims for the classification of the standing dead trees and the detection of lying dead trees

1st script refers to general processing of .las files (filtering noise and height) as well as the annotation accuracy assessment.

2nd script contains the functions used for the pre-processing and the segmentation of trees.

3rd script refers to the segmentation of trees, some graphs to evaluate the results and the LDA analysis.

4th script is based on template matching analysis for the detection of the lying trees
